Simple extension to maintain a list of scrathes similar to JetBrains IntelliJ scrathes feature. Scratches are simply a text documents, persisted across all workspaces, that are available through a dedicated view panel in explorer view.

## Features

Extension's features include:

- Dedicated scratches panel in explorer view
- Commands to create and delete scratch (look for `Scratches: ...` in `Command + P` menu)

## Extension Settings

## Future plans and fixes

- I want to easily find some past scratchpads, ideally with fuzzy search.
  - TODO: Have a full textsearch across all scratches, ideally with fuzzy matching and ranking by recency.
  - TODO: Have an archive of old scratches, excluded from search and listing by default, but accessible when needed.

Bugs

- FIXME: Breadcrumbs for scratches not showing the root "Scratches" folder.
- FIXME: No delete button in the scratchpad explorer view
